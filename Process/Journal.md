## Ori and the Will of the Wisps
Ori and the Will of the Wisps is a 2D metroidvania platformer created by Moon Studios. You play as Ori, a forest spirit, who embarks on a journey to save the forest of Niwen. This game has several interesting mechanics which I find especially inspiring. 

### Bash Ability
The core idea of a metroidvania is the player needing to progress, earn a new ability, and tackle previously explored areas with that new ability to get to previously unreachable places, and so on. Often, these games fall into the trap of single abilities being only useful in one specific context, for instance, a red ability unlocks the red door. Bash, on the other hand, manages to recontextualize the entire game. The Bash ability allows Ori to use certain in-game props to propel themselves in a chosen, aimed direction. There are several bash-able objects in the game, but most notably, Ori can bash off of enemies. This completely alters how the player moves through the world. For instance, areas ridden with dangerous flying enemies are suddenly areas with infinite upward movement for Ori and difficult enemies and projectiles can be bashed at one another. 

### Burrow Ability
The Burrow ability allows Ori to enter a high-speed burrowing state when they enter sandy areas. The strength of this ability lies in how varied its uses are depending on where you are in the environment. You can dig through the sand on the ground, or dig-dash through suspended sand boulders and disappearing sandy platforms. Even though this ability does somewhat have the problem of only being relevant in the desert area, I still think it’s a masterful example because of just how well it integrates itself into Ori’s moveset.

### Where have the designers failed?
I have loved almost everything except Ori and the Will of the Wisps, except one area: the Mouldwood Depths. This area is submerged in dangerous darkness that requires the player to carefully navigate between the few light points in the area. In a game centred around fluid, fast-paced platforming, this slow and careful area feels counter-intuitive. Suddenly the tricks the player has been learning to improve their navigation throughout the world of Ori are completely useless as the unforgiving environment forces the pace to slow to a crawl. 

### Techniques that could be used in personal projects?
I feel especially inspired by how Ori uses the actions the player can take as verbs. Ori doesn’t add new buttons for every new ability the player has. Instead, new abilities get integrated seamlessly into the moveset based on the overarching verb that move falls under. For instance, the underwater dash and burrow both use the same key as the early game Dash ability, since all three involve a burst of speed, the only difference being what environment Ori is in. Similarly, the bash and the grapple abilities both use the same controls. These design decisions help the gameplay feel fluid and not clunky. I feel inspired to take this approach when designing player movesets, as opposed to simply bloating the game with more complex controls that don’t feel natural.
